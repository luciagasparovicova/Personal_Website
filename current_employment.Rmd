Coordination and Data Collection/Analysis in the FEEL-KJ Study
---

I'm currently managing and participating in the data collection process to recruit children and adolescents in schools and clinics for the FEEL-KJ study. We use LimeSurvey hosted on the Faculty of Psychology's servers for the online portion of the FEEL-KJ study. 

Furthermore, I'm responsible for data cleaning, preparation and (preliminary) analysis of the number of participants per age to ensure that we have a sufficient sample size by the end of the data collection phase of the FEEL-KJ study. I use either SPSS or R Studio depending on what is more suitable for the current task. 


Dissertation Work to Attain my PhD at the University of Basel 
---

I'm simultaneously working on attaining my PhD at the University of Basel. My dissertation is about children's and adolesecents' emotion regulation of their negative emotions, that is, how children and adolescents deal with their anger, sadness and fear. 

My first of three manuscripts, a review on comparing European emotion regulation questionnaires for children and adolescents has been [preregistered](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368661488_PREREGISTRATION_Comparing_Questionnaires_Assessing_Emotion_Regulation_in_Children_and_Adolescents_Validated_in_European_Countries_A_Narrative_Review) and submitted. 

I'm currently working on my second manuscript that examines the moderating influence of executive functioning on emotion regulation and problem behaviour in typically-developing children and adolescents.

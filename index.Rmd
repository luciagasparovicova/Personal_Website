I'm **Lucia Gasparovicova** and I'm currently working as a **research assistant/Ph.d student in adolescent emotion regulation** at the Division of Personality and Developmental Psychology at the University of Basel.

Apart from being able to follow my innate curiousity in my daily **research and data analysis work**, I also enjoy **drawing illustrations** in my free time, such as the one above. 


Through one way or another, you have come across my personal website. I hope you'll find the information you're looking for and will have **an enjoyable stay** here!
